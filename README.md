# Audio Transcriber Frontend

This React Vite frontend application allows users to upload MP3 audio files and receive text transcriptions from an audio transcription backend service.

## Features

- Upload MP3 files
- View transcriptions of uploaded audio

Ensure the backend service is running at http://localhost:8080. The frontend communicates with the backend through the /api/transcribe endpoint.

For more details on the backend service, visit the [Audio Transcriber Backend repository](https://github.com/Jonathan-Tong1/audio-transcriber-backend).
